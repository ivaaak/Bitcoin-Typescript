A typescript implementation of bitcoin.

This implementation includes core Bitcoin concepts:

- Proof of work mining
- Block creation and chaining
- Transaction handling
- Mining rewards with halving
- Maximum supply limit
- Basic chain validation

Missing advanced features (TODOs):

- P2P networking
- Wallet management
- UTXO model
- Merkle trees
- Scripting system
- Lightning Network

- Some sort of visualization of what is going on when its running
